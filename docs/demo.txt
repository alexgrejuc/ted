ted has basic functionality for viewing, editing and creating prose text files.

It has an insert and edit mode.

It starts out in insert mode, which supports:

* Navigating with arrow keys
* Inserting text
* Removing text with the backspace key

While code editors navigate vertically over newlines, ted navigates vertically over lines as they appear visually.

Pressing escape toggles the mode.

Edit mode supports:

* Navigating with arrow keys
* Selecting the current word or sentence. And the current paragraph.
* Cutting, copying, and pasting the selection.
* Toggling the case of the selection.
* Deleting the selection.
* Saving the file to <filename>.ted and quitting
