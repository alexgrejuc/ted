It starts out in insert mode, which supports:
    * Inserting text
    * Would it even be a text editor if you couldn't do that?
    * Navigating with arrow keys
    * Removing text with the backspace

Pressing escape toggles the mode.

Edit mode supports:
    * Navigating with arrow keys
    * Selecting the current word or sentence. And the current paragraph.
    * Cutting, copying, and pasting the selection.
    * toggling the case of the selection.
    * Saving the file to <filename>.ted and quitting
